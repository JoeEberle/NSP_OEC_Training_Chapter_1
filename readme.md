## 1.1 The Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) program of the National Ski Patrol (NSP) has evolved to become one of the most recognized emergency care programs tailored for outdoor environments, particularly in ski and snow sports settings. Here's an overview of its evolution and purpose:

**1.1 Evolution of the OEC Program:**
- **Origins (1980s)**: The OEC program was developed in the 1980s in response to a need for standardized medical training among NSP members. Previously, ski patrollers came from various medical backgrounds, including doctors, EMTs, and nurses, but there was no consistent training. To unify the skills and knowledge across patrollers, the NSP collaborated with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) to design the OEC curriculum.
- **Development of OEC Curriculum**: In 1985, the first OEC textbook was published. It was based on the EMT curriculum but tailored specifically for outdoor environments, focusing on situations common to skiing and snow sports. The curriculum included modules on patient assessment, trauma care, environmental emergencies, and musculoskeletal injuries, among other topics.
- **Expansion and Updates**: Over the years, the OEC program expanded and revised its curriculum to stay current with advancements in medical care and to cover a broader range of outdoor activities. New editions of the OEC textbook have been released regularly, incorporating updates in emergency care techniques, equipment, and outdoor scenarios. The latest versions also focus on wilderness first aid and non-urban settings.
- **Certification and National Recognition**: The OEC program became recognized as the primary certification for ski patrollers across the United States. NSP members are required to maintain OEC certification through continuous education, practical training, and recertification every three years. It has also gained recognition in broader outdoor industries, with many wilderness guides and outdoor workers obtaining OEC certification.
- **Purpose of the OEC Program**:
- **Standardized Emergency Medical Training for Outdoor Environments**: The main goal of the OEC program is to provide standardized training to individuals in providing emergency care in outdoor settings, particularly for ski patrol members. It equips patrollers with skills to manage injuries and illnesses that occur on the slopes or in wilderness areas, often in remote, challenging conditions far from immediate medical care.
- **Focused on Outdoor Sports and Recreation**: The program focuses on the specific demands and situations encountered in snow sports, like ski-related injuries, cold-related conditions (hypothermia, frostbite), and avalanche rescue. However, it also covers broader outdoor emergencies, such as water rescues, heat illness, and trauma from falls or wilderness accidents.
- **Preparing for Pre-Hospital Care**: OEC-trained patrollers act as first responders, bridging the gap between the time of injury and professional medical care. They are trained to assess, stabilize, and transport injured individuals, often working in rough terrain and extreme weather.
- **Adapting to Non-Urban Settings**: One of the unique aspects of OEC training is its emphasis on providing care in non-urban, remote settings, where resources are limited. The program teaches improvisation skills, patient stabilization for long-term transport, and working with minimal equipment.
- **Impact and Reach**: The OEC program has expanded beyond just ski patrolling. It is now a recognized credential for those involved in various outdoor recreation fields, including mountain rescue teams, park rangers, and wilderness guides. Its blend of medical knowledge and practical outdoor skills makes it a key training program for first responders in remote areas. The program continues to be a cornerstone of the National Ski Patrol's mission to promote safety and provide rescue services in outdoor recreational environments.


## 1.2 Describe the evolution and purpose of the National Ski Patrol's OEC program.


2. The founder of the National Ski Patrol is **Charles Minot "Minnie" Dole**. He established the organization in 1938 to provide organized rescue and emergency medical care for injured skiers. Dole was inspired to create the National Ski Patrol after a skiing accident involving a friend, which highlighted the need for trained individuals to assist injured skiers on the slopes.


## OEC Certification Process

The Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) certification and recertification processes are essential for individuals, particularly National Ski Patrol (NSP) members, to provide effective emergency care in outdoor environments. Here's an overview of each process:

OEC Certification Process:
Eligibility: Anyone interested in becoming an OEC Technician can pursue certification, though it is most common among individuals involved in outdoor activities such as ski patrollers, wilderness guides, and outdoor emergency responders. No prior medical experience is required to enroll.

OEC Course:

The certification process starts with completing the OEC course, which typically spans 80 to 120 hours of training. The course covers:
- Patient assessment
- Trauma care
- Management of musculoskeletal injuries
- Medical emergencies (e.g., heart attacks, strokes)
- Environmental emergencies (e.g., hypothermia, heat stroke)
- Rescue and transport techniques in outdoor environments
- Wilderness first aid and improvisation

The course is designed to equip participants with skills to handle emergencies in rugged and remote outdoor settings, often with limited equipment and support.
Classroom and Practical Training:

The course includes a combination of classroom learning (lectures, discussions, and studying the OEC textbook) and hands-on practical training. Participants engage in simulated emergency scenarios, patient assessments, and practice using emergency equipment in outdoor settings.
Instructors are usually experienced OEC Technicians, such as certified ski patrollers or outdoor emergency responders.

### Examinations:
1. Written Exam: Participants must pass a written examination that tests their knowledge of OEC concepts, procedures, and medical care guidelines.
2. Practical Exam: Participants are also required to pass a practical exam, which evaluates their ability to apply their knowledge in real-life scenarios. They are assessed on their skills in:

### Patient assessment
1. Trauma management
2. Splinting and bandaging
3. Emergency evacuation and transport techniques

The practical exam often takes place in outdoor settings to simulate real conditions.

Certification:

Once participants pass both the written and practical exams, they receive the OEC Technician certification, making them qualified to provide outdoor emergency care. Certification is typically valid for three years.
OEC Recertification Process:
To maintain their OEC certification, OEC Technicians must complete a recertification process every three years. This process ensures that technicians stay updated on the latest medical procedures and outdoor emergency care practices.

Refresher Course:

Annual Refresher: The NSP requires OEC Technicians to participate in an annual refresher course. These courses cover one-third of the OEC curriculum each year, ensuring that all material is reviewed over the three-year period.
The refresher focuses on:
Key skills and knowledge updates
Hands-on practice with scenarios that include patient assessment, trauma management, and rescue techniques
Updates to medical guidelines or new emergency care techniques introduced in the latest OEC textbook editions
Online Learning Modules:

NSP offers online learning components as part of the recertification process. Technicians may complete online quizzes, review materials, and other learning exercises to reinforce their knowledge between refreshers.
Practical Skill Evaluation:

During the refresher course, technicians must demonstrate their competency through hands-on skills tests. These practical evaluations may involve working through patient scenarios, performing splinting, bandaging, or rescue simulations.
The goal is to ensure that each technician can still effectively apply their OEC skills in real-world emergency situations.
Recertification Examination:

While the primary focus of recertification is on skills refreshers and hands-on training, technicians may also be required to complete a recertification exam or assessment that evaluates their updated knowledge of OEC practices.
The written component of the recertification process is sometimes included, particularly if significant changes or updates have been made to the curriculum.
Maintaining Active Status:

OEC Technicians are expected to complete their annual refreshers and stay active within their NSP unit or other outdoor organizations where they provide emergency care. Consistent practice and engagement help ensure they are prepared to handle emergencies effectively.
If a technician misses the three-year recertification window, they may need to go through an extended recertification process, which involves completing additional training or exams.
Purpose of the Recertification Process:
The recertification process is designed to ensure that all OEC Technicians remain:

Competent and skilled in providing outdoor emergency care
Up-to-date with the latest emergency care standards, procedures, and best practices
Prepared to handle evolving challenges in outdoor environments, such as new sports or environmental risks
Overall, the OEC certification and recertification processes ensure that outdoor responders can provide high-quality emergency care in a variety of rugged and challenging conditions, continuing the National Ski Patrol's mission of safety and rescue.


## Good Samaritan laws

**Good Samaritan laws** are designed to protect individuals who voluntarily provide emergency assistance in good faith from legal liability, as long as they act reasonably and without gross negligence. For volunteers, these laws offer protection when they respond to emergencies, such as providing first aid or performing CPR, even if they are not medical professionals.

Impact on Volunteers:
**Legal Protection: Volunteers**, including trained responders like ski patrollers or ordinary bystanders, are generally protected from lawsuits if their assistance inadvertently causes harm, as long as they act within their level of training and without gross negligence.

**Encouragement to Act**: The laws encourage people to help in emergency situations without fear of being sued for unintentional mistakes, promoting quicker responses to emergencies.

**Limitations**: These protections usually don’t apply if the volunteer acts recklessly, outside their training, or expects compensation.

Overall, Good Samaritan laws foster a culture of helping by reducing the legal risks for volunteers who step in during emergencies.


## Standard of Training & Standard of Care

The **standard of training** and **standard of care** are both important concepts in emergency response, but they differ in focus:

**Standard of Training**: Refers to the level of knowledge and skills that a responder is expected to have based on the training they have received. It is defined by the guidelines and procedures taught during their certification or educational programs, such as OEC training for ski patrollers.
**Example**: A certified OEC technician is trained in specific techniques for managing trauma and must adhere to those methods.


**Standard of Care**: Refers to the level of care that a reasonably trained and experienced individual would provide in similar circumstances. It focuses on how the responder applies their training in a real-life situation, ensuring that the care provided meets accepted medical or procedural standards.
**Example**: During an emergency, an OEC technician is expected to follow proper procedures (e.g., assessing the patient, stabilizing injuries) that meet recognized medical guidelines.
In summary, standard of training is about what someone has learned, while standard of care is about how they apply that knowledge in practice to meet acceptable care expectations.

## Legal Terms

Here are six legal terms related to providing Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC):

1. **Consent**: Before providing care, an OEC technician must obtain permission from the patient. This can be express consent (verbal or written) or implied consent if the patient is unconscious or unable to give consent but in need of urgent care.
2. **Good Samaritan Law**: Laws that protect OEC technicians or volunteers from legal liability when they provide emergency care in good faith, without expecting compensation, as long as they act within their training and without gross negligence.
3. **Negligence**: Failure to act with the level of care that a reasonably trained person would in similar circumstances. Negligence can occur if an OEC technician fails to provide care according to their training, leading to harm.
4. **Duty to Act**: Some responders, such as ski patrollers on duty, have a duty to act, meaning they are legally required to provide care when needed. Off-duty responders may not have this same obligation unless state laws dictate otherwise.
5. **Abandonment**: Once an OEC technician begins providing care, they cannot leave the patient until someone of equal or higher training takes over. Leaving a patient without proper care can result in a charge of abandonment.
6. **Standard of Care**: The legal expectation that an OEC technician provides care at the level that a similarly trained professional would in similar circumstances. Deviating from this standard can result in claims of negligence.
These terms help define the legal responsibilities and protections for OEC providers in emergency situations.

## Consent

Here are four key concepts related to **consent** in providing emergency care, including Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC):

1. **Informed Consent**: This occurs when a patient understands the nature of the care being offered and voluntarily agrees to it. The OEC provider must explain the proposed treatment, risks, and benefits in a way the patient can comprehend before obtaining consent.
2. **Expressed Consent**: When a patient explicitly gives verbal or written permission for care. For example, a conscious patient might verbally agree to let a ski patroller treat a broken limb.
3. **Implied Consent**: Implied consent is assumed when a patient is unable to give express consent (e.g., unconscious or incapacitated), but a reasonable person would want lifesaving care. It's often used in emergency situations when immediate action is required.
3. **Minor Consent**: For minors (under 18 in most regions), consent must be obtained from a parent or legal guardian. However, in emergencies when no guardian is available, implied consent allows treatment to proceed to prevent harm to the child.

These concepts ensure that medical care is provided with respect for the patient’s rights while allowing emergency responders to act in urgent situations.
